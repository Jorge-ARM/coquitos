# üßÆ BMI Calculator

The **BMI Calculator** is a tool that calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) based on your weight and height.

## üå± Purpose

This project was created to:

* Practice JavaScript functions and event handling.
* Experiment with responsive design.
* Design different types of inputs such as select, text fields and buttons

## üß© Structure

The project consists of the following files:

* `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the application.
* `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the application.
* `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the logic for BMI calculation.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. The user selects the measurement system.
2. The user enters their weight and height in the input fields.
3. When the "Calculate Your BMI" button is clicked, the `script.js` file processes the inputs.
4. The BMI is calculated using the appropriate formula:
   - Metric: $BMI = \frac{weight}{height^2}$
   - Imperial: $BMI = \frac{weight}{height^2} \times 703$
5. The result is displayed. If there's no text in the text fields, the result will be a red text error.

## üí¨ Notes

This is a fun and lighthearted project meant for learning and experimentation. Feel free to explore, modify and improve it!
