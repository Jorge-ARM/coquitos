# 🥥 Coquitos

**Coquitos** is a personal collection of small projects and experiments all gathered in one place. Instead of filling my main portfolio with small demos or unfinished ideas, this repository serves as a home for them.

## 🌱 Purpose

This repo exists to:

* Keep track of my small coding experiments and daily practices.
* Showcase how I approach learning and problem-solving.
* Share ideas and snippets that might inspire or help others.

## 🧩 Structure

Each directory contains:

* Its own `README.md` (if needed) explaining what it does.
* Independent code that can be run or explored separately.
## 🛠️ Technologies

Depending on the project, you’ll find code written in:

* **JavaScript**
* **Go**
* **Python**
* **Node.js**
* **HTML | CSS**
* and other tools I’m experimenting with.

## 💬 Notes

These are learning material, prototypes and creative exercises.
Feel free to explore and fork any of them.# coquitos
